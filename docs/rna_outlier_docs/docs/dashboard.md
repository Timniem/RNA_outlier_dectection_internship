# Panel Dashboard


To install the dashboard follow the same steps as shown in Quick start in [Pipeline](pipeline.md).

If the dashboard is run on a computing cluster, you want to forward the chosen port to a local machine.

To run the dashboard execute the following command:

```
bash run_dashboard.sh -p [port] -d [data_folder]
```
